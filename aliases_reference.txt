rlabel [add|delete|info] [label] [vnum] - Adds, deletes, or returns information for a room label. A vnum argument is only needed when adding a room.
run [c|label|vnum] - Determines the most optimal route to the given room, and starts walking you there. If 'c' is given instead of a valid room label or vnum, your last destination will be used.
stop - Cancels the auto-walking of the 'run' command.
savemap - saves the loaded map file to disk.
sync [label|vnum] - Manually sync the map to the given room label or vnum. if no label or vnum is given, the 'sync' command will set the mapper's synced state to unsynced, and send a 'look' command to the server.

***Labels Script: now unused***
rlabel [add [label] [room ID]|delete [label]|information [label|all]] - Handles room labels. (Commands can be abbreviated)

***Mapper Script: now unused***
mapreload - Reloads the map file. (useful if you wish to discard changes you might have made to the map file since the last save)
mapsave - Saves your changes to the map file.
rinfo [room ID] - returns detailed information about the room with the given ID.  If no ID is supplied, will return information about the room that the mapper thinks you are currently in.
rfind [c|string] - performs a case-insensitive, fuzzy search for rooms that contain string in their names. If  'c' is supplied instead of a string, will perform an case-sensitive, exact search for the last captured room name from the game. It is important to use this command to make sure there are no other rooms with the same name as the current one before syncing with the 'sync' command.
rnote [room ID] [none|text] - If a room ID is given as the first argument, the operation will be performed on the room with that ID; otherwise, the current room will be used. If the word 'none' is given instead of some text, the room's note will be deleted; otherwise, the room's note will be set to the given text. If no text is given, the room's note will be displayed.
run [l[ label]|n[ note]|c|i [room ID]|string] - start automatically walking from your current location to a destination. If 'i' and a room ID are given, will run to the room with the given ID.  If 'c' is given, will recalculate a new route to your previous destination and start running. If 'l' and some text are given, the destination will be set to the room with the corresponding label. If 'n' and some text are given, the destination will be set to the room which contains a note matching text. If neither 'i', 'c', 'l', or 'n' are given, will perform a case-insensitive, fuzzy search for room names that match string, and start running to the first result.
unrun - If you are currently running, will stop.
sync - Sets your location in the map to the last captured room name from the game. Make sure to use this command as soon as possible after logging on, and only use it in a room with a unique name.  If you are unsure if the current room name is unique, use 'rfind c'.

Path Walker Script:
p [direction] - If you are are on a road, will start following the road in the given direction using the '=' signs around road exits in the exits line. The script will stop walking if there are more then 1 possible road out of the room, not including the direction you came from (I.E. a junction).

Secrets Script:
dadd [secret name] [direction] - Add a secret exit to the current room in the secrets database.  For example: 'dadd colvert e'. Short forms of directions [e|ea|eas] will automatically be converted to their long form 'east'.
ddel [room name|all] [direction|all] - Deletes 1 or more secret exits from the room. Like the 'dadd' command, direction names are automatically converted to their long forn. The word 'all' is a wild card. If there are no more secret exits for the current room after the deletion, the room is automatically removed from the database. Examples: 'ddel wall e' (delete the secret named 'wall' that's to the 'east', but leave the wall that's too the north), 'ddel all e' (delete all secret exits in the room that are located to the east), 'ddel stonedoor all' (Delete all secrets named 'stonedoor' from the room, no matter what direction they are located), 'ddel all all' (delete all the secrets from the room, and remove the room entry from the database).
ddis [string] - Displays all the secrets (if any) for a room or rooms. If the user provides a string to be searched for, a case-insensitive, fuzzy search is performed for all room names in the database matching string. Otherwise, a case-sensitive, exact search is performed for the last captured room name from the mud.
ddo - Open all secret exits in the current room.

Sounds Script:
playsound [file|directory] - Play a sound file from the 'sounds' directory. If a file name is given, it will be played in the background.
